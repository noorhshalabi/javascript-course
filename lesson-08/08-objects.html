      //local storage, stores permanently
      //when we refresh the page, evrything gets deleted in rock paper scissors

      //AUTOBOXING
      //JS automatically wraps a string into an object like a "box"
      //doesnt work with null or undefined
      //OBJECTS ARE REFERENCES
 
      //we think that we are creating a value that has other values inside
      //and the nwe store it in a variable. It's not like this.
      //When we create an object like this, the actual value is created somewhere in computers memory
      //and this variable actually just gets a reference that points to that location in memory
      //Shortcut on a computer - shortcut points to the actual file
      //no way to see this reference. But this is a reference
      //Makes language more efficient?
      const object1 = {
        message: 'hello'
      }

      const object2 = object1; //makes copy of the reference that points to the object.
      //say we had a massive object 1, its inefficient to create the whole object. Copying is faster*.


      //Behaviors of references
      object1.message = 'Good job!';
      //1. const prevents us from changing the reference in the variable, but it doesn't prevent us from reaching into the reference
      //and changing the object that it's pointing to

      console.log(object1);
      console.log(object2); //2. also gets changed to Good job even though we changed object 1

      const object3 = {
        message: 'Good job!'
      }
      console.log(object1 === object3);
      //3. You cant comapre objects - will say its false even tho its equal. Objects are references. It compares the references, not the actual values
      //Thats why it's false. 
      //However with object 2, its pointing to the reference of object 1
      console.log(object1 === object2); //so it will output true because same references!!

      //SHORTCUTS for objects - get message outside of object
      const object4 = {
        message: 'Good job!',
        price: 799
      }
      //const message = object4.message;
      //Shortcut : DESTRUCTURING - can do single value or multiple
      const { message, price } = object4; //DESTRUCTURING* to take out message from object4 and display 
      console.log(message);
      console.log(price);

      //Shorthand property - using variable inside the value. instead of doing this, u call it just message. message:message == message
      // const object5 = { 
      //   message,
      //   method: function function1() {
      //     console.log('method');
      //   }
      // };

      //shorthand method way
      const object6 = {
        message,
        method() {
          console.log('method');
