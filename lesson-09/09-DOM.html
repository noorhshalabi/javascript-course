      /* This code removes everything on page and replaces with text

      //Now that we learned objects, we can understand this syntax
      //Document = built in object and the . is the dot notation
      //accessing a property of the document called body
      //body is an object, so you use dot notation again to access
      //the property of body, which is inner HTML
      // change the inner HTML to the string, hello
      // Special about innerHTML, it changes the web page. Document object + web page = linked together
      document.title = 'Good job' //changes top of the tab
      
      //document object represents / models the webpage
      //Why we call it Document Object Model

        if we change certain properties, will change webpage
        it has methods u can use
    */
     
    /*
     console.log(document.title); //linked to title
     console.log(document.body); //will get body html, and put it inside our JS
    */ 

    // you'll see the code within the console. 
    //   YOU CAN HAVE HTML elements inside our javascript ^^ proof
    //   The DOM combines javascript and HTML togetehr and gives javescript control of the webpage

    //   so now we have html element inside JS? What can we do with it?
    //   HTML is converted to javascript object if you do console.log(typeof document.body --> that will o/p as object)
    //   just like any other object, this has properties and methods we can use
    //   useful property of the body element is innerHTML, which controls all the HTML inside the body.
    //   if you access this property, you get all the HTML inside the body
    //   document.body.innerHTML = '<button>Good Job!</button>';
     
    //   Learning method of the document object that we can use.
    //   Reminder - method is a funciton that is saved inside an object
    //  document.querySelector lets use get any element from the page and put it inside our JS
    
    //will get the first button element from the page and put inside our JS
    //can control the element too, modify
    console.log(document.querySelector('button').innerHTML);
    document.querySelector('button').innerHTML = 'Changed';
    
    //if our query selector will get only one button on the page, how do we get the second?
    //we add an attribute to the button called the class attribute, label 
    //do '.' + 'class name' to look for any class --> This is called a *class selector*
    //can also save into a variable
    const buttonElement = document.querySelector('.js-button');
    console.log(buttonElement);

    //all in all, a DOM will combine Html and JS together. It gives JS full control of the webpage.
    // practical example next
    //Practical example target - Creating a button that gets modified after click (youtube subscribe button)
    //Getting rock paper scissors to display "on a new page"
    //the amazon calculator
    //we will then use CSS to make the webpage look better, but focusing only on functionality
    
     //if the string only contains a number, and we - * / , it will be converted to a number
     String(25)
    console.log('25'-5);
    //not recommended to do math with strings bc addition behaves differently
    console.log('25'+5); //output = 30
    
    
    //document represents web page
    //window represents browser, where document is within window
    //console is a part of the browser too
    //window.document;
    window.console.log('window');
    window.alert;
    //window has a shortcut, JS will automatically add window in the front
