      //we're going to work on the cart feature - when u hit add to cart, the cart in the top right will increment by 1
      //just a simpler version instead
      //three ways to create - let, const, 
      //const is safer and easier to understand. When we craete with const, you know it'll always contain 3.
      //let, u wont know what it is.
      //best practice - use const by default.

      //can use var, can be changed. The original way to create variable. But, not ideal to use now.
      //can use typeof - which will tell us what type something is. U can use typeof to figure out what type of value inside a variable.
