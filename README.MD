-Purpose of this course was to understand the nuances of javascript, the javascript basics, and how it works while creating small projects to understand concepts as a whole
-Over time, in each lesson, course allowed me to see the optimizations and understand how the javascript language is used in a practical sense.
-This code was created as I walked through the course in VSC Editor. Any code that is mine, will be in a seperate project. Credits to SuperSimpleDev On youtube. Though I followed along, now I understand what I'm looking at. I now understand Numbers, Strings, Variables, booleans, if-statements, functions (Different types covered: Anonymous, named, callback, arrow, higher order function, IIFE), objects, DOM (use case), combining with HTML/CSS, arrays, and loops in JS.

  - Goal of taking this was to really understand the inner workings and have an overall idea of the picture itself. To try to understand promises and async/wait and asynchronous operations better. 
    - Execution Context
    - Memory
    - Callstack
  - Next to learn : Task Queue & Event Loop, Memory Storage, and the Javascript Enginer

  - To try to understand ASYNC/AWAIT


-Games (Look in results folder to see how it looks)
  - Rock Paper Scissors : R S P keyboard can use to play that way, computer can play against himself, click using event listener instead of on click. Was able to learn how to make buttons interactive where it records what I click and compared against a randomized computer move generator, how to use localStorage to record the statistics of the game. How to reset that score. 
  - Simple Todo list : understanding event listeners. Uses event listeners for every item on the list in terms of the delete. This was to learn how to generate HTML via JS. 

- So Far Covered in 12 hour JS Course: 
  - Javascript basics - Syntax, how it interacts between html/css
  - Numbers and Math in JS
  - Strings : String interpolation and why to use that vs concatenation
    - what happens when you add a string + number and why you have to convert using Number(String) + #.
    - String's length can be measured, indexOf a certain position, replace a string with a new string with .replace
    -slice --> when u return a substring of the string based on start and end of index arg u pass in
    -.split --> conversion to array
    - .concat -> firstName ('Noor) + middleName (' Hussein) == firstName.concat(middleName,' Shalabi') = Noor Hussein Shalabi
  - Operators and how it's different from java
  - Variables (const, let, var) and when to use each
  - Booleans and If Else conditions
    - logical operators
    - Truthy/Falsey Values
  - Functions and how they are created in JS, how you tie into HTML buttons, text boxes, etc. Also features like Closures. 
  - Objects in JS - how they are represented, how they are stored in memory and what are references in relation to objects
  - Document Object Model - how to use document.querySelect() to pull HTML into JS object, how document = contents within webpage, window = entire webpage. window.document e.g
  - Learned the Element property of a certain letter on a keyboard - u can track VIA events. onkeydown html
  - Tied HTML, CSS, and Javascript together and into a project - rock paper scissors, simple calculator, making a button interactive
- Learned how to seperate files and link them, organizing the code within JSS
- Arrays and Loops
  - Arrays are references. When you create 1 array, then create another that is set to that array. 
  -Say you add 4 to array1. Array2 will also be modified.
  - To avoid this - you use slice. Array2= array1.slice() will create a copy
  -slice ^^
  - [1,2,3] to get certain values. You do destructuring. const [firstValue, secondValue] = [1,2,3] 
  -push
  -Loops
    - break - exists loop early
    -continue ; skip a run of the loop if condition is met
    - Arrow Functions
    - forEach 
  - Filter Array Method
  - Map
- Lesson 12 - mainly switching to arrow functions and for each functions for existing projects, understanding differences
  -Also using event listeners instead of onclick in html, removed onclick, created an event listener to listen for "click"
